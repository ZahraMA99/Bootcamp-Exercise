==> Objects work just like a dictionary you could find in the library
==> Objects is an key-value store 
==> key is "uniqe"


ex. 

let person = {
  name: "Mariah",
  occupation: "Gangster"
}

** important note 
Note that the value of any key can be anything. Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, other objects, even functions*!


** access element in object => 2-ways:
        1. person.eagle = 24
        2. person["eagle"] = 24



** note :
As opposed to strings, numbers, and booleans which are all primitive types, arrays and objects are reference types.
JS does not create a new space in memory for reference types. Instead, it references an existing space, if possible.
